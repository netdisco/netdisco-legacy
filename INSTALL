REQUIREMENTS

    Netdisco is built using lots of fine Open-Source tools:

    * Perl
        5.6.1 and newer advised.

        5.8.1 on Mandrake 9.x may be a problem (if you get an "out of
        memory" error, you may need to change to 5.6.1 or 5.8.2).

    * Perl Modules
        Listed below

    * Net-SNMP
        5.0.2 and newer advised. Untested on 5.1.x

    * PostgreSQL
        Developed under version 7.3

        Reported working for versions 7.2, 7.3, 7.4

    * Mason
        1.16 or newer required

    * Apache
        1.3.x advised, Version 2.x not supported by mod_perl.

    * mod_perl
        Version to match Apache - 1.28 or higher recommended.

        Do not install version 1.99.

    * GraphViz
        Version 0.10 or higher recommended.

    See *INSTALL* below for details on how to retrieve and install each one.

  OS

    Netdisco was developed on a Free BSD system but should work on any
    system that Postgres, Perl, Apache, and Net-SNMP run on.

    Linux is a sure bet. Netdisco has been tested with Mandake 9.1 and
    includes specific notes to install with it. Successful installs have
    been reported under Redhat, Mandrake, Gentoo and Debian.

    One user has reported getting Netdisco running on OS X.

    Windows will take a lot of massaging but should be possible under
    Cygwin.

INSTALL

    This is not a terribly easy install. If you aren't comfortable
    installing programs from source and using a text editor, get some help.
    Hopefully this will all be rolled up into an install script by the time
    Netdisco comes out of Beta.

  1. Download and Un-archive Netdisco

    Get the newest version from <http://www.netdisco.org>.

        tar xvfz netdisco-x.xx.tar.gz    

    Create a directory for Netdisco

        mkdir /usr/local/netdisco

    Move files to that dir

        mv netdisco-x.xx/* /usr/local/netdisco

  2. Create a Unix User/Group for Netdisco

    Create a user and group named "netdisco"

    Linux
            useradd -d /usr/local/netdisco netdisco

    BSD
            adduser netdisco

    Give this user permission to the files:

        chown -R netdisco.netdisco /usr/local/netdisco

  3. Add Unix Administrators to Netdisco Group

    Once Netdisco is up and running most administration can be done from the
    Web interface. Whoever will be doing the back-end administration will
    need to have write access and will need write access on Netdisco's
    files.

    Add the unix account names of administrators that will modify the source
    code or use the command line interface interface to the "netdisco" group
    in /etc/groups.

    Don't forget to logout and login after adding yourself to a group.

  4. PostgreSQL

    Netdisco runs Postgres as its database back-end. A mySQL port is
    reported to be in development.

   4.1. Install Postgres

    1. BSD
        First install Postgres from ports:

            cd /usr/ports/database/postgresql7
            gmake install

        Next initialize the database :

            more /usr/local/pgsql/post-install-notes
            su -l pgsql -c initdb 

    2. Mandrake Linux
        Installing PostgreSQL the easy way:

            urpmi postgresql postgresql-devel postgresql-server postgresql-docs

        The files you will need to edit below are in /var/lib/pgsql/data.

        If you lost / don't have install CDs :

        The following line uses an FTP site that has the 9.0 RPMs because I
        lost the CDs. Check the current mirror list at
        <http://www.mandrakelinux.com/en/ftp.php3> and choose a mirror close
        to you.

            urpmi.addmedia ftpsite ftp://mirror.mcs.anl.gov/pub/Mandrake-old/9.0/i586/Mandrake/RPMS \
                with ../base/hdlist.cz

        Now you have to add "--media ftpsite" in each "urpmi" command like
        so :

            urpmi --media ftpsite postgresql postgresql-devel

        Remember this for the Apache setup too.

    3. MAC OS X
        See <http://developer.apple.com/internet/macosx/postgres.html> for
        detailed instructions on installing PostgreSQL with OS X.

    4. All Others
        There is probably a binary package all ready for you. See your
        distribution's instructions for more help. Otherwise download and
        compile the source code from <http://www.postgresql.org>.

   4.2. Configure Postgres

    Netdisco's settings in PostgreSQL are

     Database User     : netdisco
     Database Name     : netdisco
     Database Password : you choose it

    Follow these steps to setup Netdisco in PostgreSQL.

    1. Permissions
        If you have just setup Postgres for the first time you may have to
        change the default permissions in $PG_DATA/pg_hba.conf. $PG_DATA
        might be in /usr/local/pgsql or in /var/db, depends on your OS.
        Check the postgres users' homedir files for the location of
        $PG_DATA.

        For installation you must give the database user access to the
        "template1" database. The following line will give all users who
        have logon permissions in Unix access to the "template1" database.

            local template1 all ident

        Next you must give the "netdisco" database user access to the
        "netdisco" database. The following line will give all database users
        access to a database that is the same name as them. This line must
        be put above all the rest of the uncommented lines in the
        pg_hba.conf file to take precedence.

        Postgres 7.2
                local sameuser md5

        Postgres 7.3
                local sameuser all md5

        Postgres 7.4
                local sameuser all crypt

        You may have to swap "md5" for "crypt", Actual mileage may vary.

    2. Restart Postgres
        You must now restart Postgres

        Linux :

            /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql restart

        FreeBSD :

            /usr/local/etc/rc.d/*pgsql* restart

        If there are problems with this step you will receive an error that
        mentions something about pg_hba.conf.

    3. Create Database.
        Make sure your copy of the database is running.

        Next, find out the name of your database user. The default name for
        some Linux RPM versions is "postgres" and for some BSD installations
        "pgsql".

        Edit the file "pg_init" to match your database user name in
        /usr/local/netdisco/sql/pg_init

            vi /usr/local/netdisco/sql/pg_init

        As root run "sql/pg_init" to create the database and user for
        Netdisco.

        The password you will be asked for twice is the new password for the
        database user you are creating. This is the same password you will
        be putting in netdisco_apache.conf and in netdisco.conf.

            cd /usr/local/netdisco/sql
            ./pg_init

    4. Check Settings
        Now as a non-privileged user make sure you can get into the database
        by running "sql/pg_run". Enter the database user password given
        above.

            cd /usr/local/netdisco/sql
            ./pg_run

    5. Create Tables
        Once you are sure the database is setup correctly, create the
        database tables with "sql/pg_all". Type in the database user
        password once when prompted.

            cd /usr/local/netdisco/sql
            ./pg_all

    6. Optimizations
        If you have freshly installed Postgresql then the default memory
        usage needs to be increased for efficiency. See the PostgreSQL
        documentation for postgresql.conf. Specifically you really need to
        up the maximum connections and shared memory settings. After you
        have Netdisco running on a large installation it would be of great
        benefit to get a Postgres guru in there to tune things for you. See
        README for more info about how to speed things up now and again.

    7. Postgres Startup
        Make sure that Postgres is set to start automatically.

        Linux
                chkconfig postgresql on

        BSD Make sure that the file in "/usr/local/etc/rc.d" is alright.

  5. SNMP

    There are three components to setup for SNMP

   5.1. Net-SNMP

    Net-SNMP 5 lives at <http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net>.

    1. Download Net-SNMP from http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net
        This used to be called ucd-snmp.

    2. Install Net-SNMP to include Perl module that comes inside the
    distribution.
        When you run "./configure", make sure you add the switch
        "--with-perl-modules"

            ./configure --with-perl-modules
            make 
            make install

        If you already have net-snmp installed, then go to the source
        directory and in the "perl" subdirectory and run "perl Makefile.PL"

            cd /path/to/net-snmp-5.0.x/perl
            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make install

         ********************************************************************

        DO NOT INSTALL the SNMP:: modules off of CPAN or the NET::SNMP
        module off of CPAN.

         ********************************************************************

        Reread the above line.

    3. [OPTIONAL] Configure Net-SNMP for a non-standard setup
        You probably will not have to do this step unless you have installed
        net-snmp somewhere other than /usr/local/ or have some specific SNMP
        defaults to change for these tools.

            snmpconf

        Make sure to set the MIB dir if non-standard (Textual mib Parsing ->
        Specifies directories to be searched for mibs) (default directory is
        /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs)

        Make sure this newly created snmp.conf lives in
        /usr/local/share/snmp or wherever you put a custom install.

    OS Notes :

    BSD For BSD install Net SNMP with ports :

            cd /usr/ports/net/net-snmp && make install

        For a recent version of BSD you should get the Perl modules
        installed automatically.

        For a really old version, or for weird and multiple Perl installs do
        it by hand!

            cd /usr/ports/net/net-snmp
            make
            cd work/net-snmp-5
            ./configure --with-perl-modules
            make
            make install

    Linux
        If you have installed the Net-SNMP RPM from Redhat or Mandrake it
        does not include the Perl modules. Uninstall it and install a newer
        version by hand as below.

        Same goes for Debian. DO NOT use the apt-get version of Net-SNMP
        install by hand (it's easy!).

   5.2. SNMP::Info

    This Perl module is an integral part of Netdisco. It is available from
    <http://snmp-info.sourceforge.net>. It requires that you have net-snmp
    installed first.

    SNMP::Info holds all the device-specific code to retrieve data from
    network devices via SNMP. A wide variety of Cisco,HP,Bay, and Aironet
    devices are supported. You may need to add support for other devices if
    they do not follow a standard interface. This is not too complex. See
    SNMP::Info for more details.

    You have three different options in installing SNMP::Info

    1. CPAN
            perl -MCPAN -e shell
                o conf prerequisites_policy ask
                install SNMP::Info

    2. From Source
        Download newest version from <http://snmp-info.sourceforge.net>

            tar xvfz SNMP-Info-0.x.tar.gz 
            cd SNMP-Info-0.x
            perl Makefile.PL
            make install

    3. From CVS
        If you plan to add or change device support in SNMP::Info to
        customize Netdisco to your devices, you should install SNMP::Info
        this way.

            make snmp

        This will create the SNMP/ directory where SNMP::Info will live.
        Periodically you should re-run

            make snmp

        To update to the most current CVS version. For BSD or Solaris
        systems, use "gmake" instead of "make"

   5.3. MIBs

    MIBs are required for SNMP::Info.

    1. Download MIBs
        Download the Version 1 and Version 2 MIBs from

            ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/v1/v1.tar.gz
            ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/v2/v2.tar.gz

    2. Install MIBs
        Install all of the V2 and some of the V1 MIBs into
        /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs.

            mkdir /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs
            cd /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs
            tar xvfz /path/to/v2.tar.gz
            tar xvfz /path/to/v1.tar.gz BRIDGE-MIB.my SNMP-REPEATER-MIB.my ESSWITCH-MIB.my TOKEN-RING-RMON-MIB.my

    3. Fix CISCO-TC-MIB
        There is a problem with the Cisco file CISCO-TC.my which is included
        from lots of other MIBs. Make the following changes if you run into
        errors about "Unsigned32" in this file.

        Edit /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs/CISCO-TC.my

        Comment out line 192 that says "SMI Unsigned32" with two dashes.

            -- SMI Unsigned32

        Add "Unsigned32" to the imports after line 19:

            IMPORTS
                MODULE-IDENTITY,
                Gauge32,
                Integer32,
                Counter64,
                Unsigned32
                    FROM SNMPv2-SMI

    Follow the instructions in "SNMP::Info" what MIBs to install for non
    Cisco devices or in case of trouble.

        perldoc SNMP::Info

  6. GraphViz  [OPTIONAL]

    GraphViz is used in the creation of the Network Map.

    It lives at <http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/>.

    1. Download

        BSD For BSD use ports:

                cd /usr/ports/graphics/graphviz && make install

        Linux
            For Redhat and Mandrake systems you will make sure that a lol of
            "-devel" packages are installed. If you see errors about not
            having a PNG or JPEG library then install the "-devel" packages
            as needed.

                urpmi libjpeg62-devel libpng3-devel

            If you get some weird error in build about not having "intl.la"
            then make sure you have the gettext packages installed :

                urpmi gettext-devel

        Unix
            Get the newest version from
            <http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz>. Unarchive and install.

        Mac OS X
            It is reported to be in "DarwinPorts" or you can check out
            <http://www.phil.uu.nl/~js/graphviz/>.

    2. True Type Font
        Copy a True Type Font file (.ttf) into the Netdisco directory and
        change "node_font" in netdisco.conf to match.

            cp /path/to/windows/fonts/lucon.ttf /usr/local/netdisco

    3. Graph Settings
        Review other graph settings in netdisco.conf

    4. Check Path
        Make sure that neato/twopi is in your path, and/or in the crontab
        path that creates the graphs.

            which twopi
            which neato

    After the Perl Modules step below, make sure the Graphviz Perl module
    got installed

        perldoc GraphViz

  7. Setup Apache

    *Apache2* --

    Until mod_perl 2.0 is released as stable, Mason will not run under
    Apache2. Netdisco will not run under Apache2 until that point.

   7.1. MAC OS X

    See the following three links in addition to this document :

    <http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2002/11/05/apache_osx.html>
    <http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2002/12/18/apache_modssl.html>
    <http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2003/02/07/libapreq_update.html>

   7.2. Mandrake 9.1

    Mandrake 9.1 comes with Apache2. It also has the option of installing a
    version of Apache1/mod_perl on a different port and then
    reverse-proxying it.

    mod_ssl with Mandrake to come...

    1. Install Apache1
        Install Apache1 and Mod_Perl 1 and their development packages :

            urpmi apache-devel-1 mod_perl-devel-1 apache-mod_perl-1 mod_perl-common-1

        Mandrake 9.1 - Do this for the DB_File Perl module

            ln -s /usr/include/db1/* /usr/include
            ln -s /usr/lib/libdb1.so.2 /usr/lib/libdb.so

    2. Configure Both Apaches
        Mandrake and some Redhats come with two copies of Apache installed.
        The mod_perl server sits on a weird port and is reversed proxied by
        a normal Apache server.

        Mandrake 9.0 uses two Apache1 servers, while Mandrake 9.1 uses an
        Apache2 server that sits in front of the apache1/mod_perl server.

        Configuration files for Mandrake live in /etc/httpd/conf

        In the file httpd-perl.conf add the two "Include" lines:

            Include /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco_apache.conf
            Include /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco_apache_dir.conf

        In the file httpd.conf (httpd2.conf for 9.1) add the final
        "RewriteRule" line:

            <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
            RewriteEngine on
            RewriteRule ^proxy:.*  -  [F]
            RewriteRule ^(.*\/perl\/.*)$  http://%{HTTP_HOST}:8200$1 [P]
            RewriteRule ^(.*\/cgi-perl\/.*)$  http://%{HTTP_HOST}:8200$1 [P]
            RewriteRule ^(.*\/netdisco\/.*)$  http://%{HTTP_HOST}:8200$1 [P]
            </IfModule>

        In the file commonhttpd.conf add the Alias line :

            Alias /netdisco /netdisco/

    3. Restart Apache
            /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart

   7.3. Apache From Scratch

    Install Apache 1.3.x and mod_perl 1.x and mod_ssl

    Netdisco is designed to work in a secure (https) or non-secure
    environment. Due to the security and privacy concerned associated with
    this data, using a secure server is recommended.

    Below is my method if you haven't installed apache and mod_perl before.
    I statically compile mod_perl, and mod_ssl then leave the rest of the
    modules as dynamically loadable objects (DSO).

    1. Download and Unarchive
        Get Apache from <http://httpd.apache.org>

        Get mod_perl from <http://perl.apache.org>

        Get mod_ssl from <http://www.modssl.org>

        Unarchive all three to the same directory, maybe /usr/local/src

    2. Inital Apache Setup
        This step makes the framework that mod_ssl and mod_perl need.

         cd apache_1.3*
         ./configure 

        No need to make it yet.

    3. mod_ssl
        Mod_SSL gives us a secure server (https) for Netdisco to run under.

        The OpenSSL library is a prerequirement for mod_ssl and may or may
        not already be on your system. If not :

        a. BSD
            Installing OpenSSL :

                cd /usr/ports/devel/mm && make install
                cd /usr/ports/security/openssl && make install

            Setup mod_ssl :

                cd /path/to/mod_ssl_1.x.x
                SSL_BASE=SYSTEM \
                    ./configure \
                        --with-apache=../apache_1.3.x \
                        --disable_rule=SSL_COMPAT

        b. RedHat / Mandrake
            OpenSSL is installed by default.

            You will have to tell the OS to look for the Kerberos libraries
            used in this version of OpenSSL:

                ./configure \
                    --with-apache=../apache_1.3.x \        
                    --disable_rule=SSL_COMPAT
                make C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/kerberos/include

            Thanks to David Martin for this info.

        c. By Hand (other OSs)
            Follow the instructions in the INSTALL that comes with "mod_ssl"

             SSL_BASE=/path/to/openssl-0.9.x \
             ./configure \
                --with-apache=../apache_1.3.x \        
                --disable_rule=SSL_COMPAT

    4. mod_perl
        This step sets up mod_perl for this copy of apache :

         cd ../mod_perl-1.x
         /usr/local/bin/perl Makefile.pl \
                APACHE_SRC=../apache_1.3.x/src \
                EVERYTHING=1 \
                DO_HTTPD=1 \
                USE_APACI=1 \
                PREP_HTTPD=1

         make

    5. Apache Again
        Now we're ready to make the main apache and install all of the above
        (mod_ssl, mod_perl, and Apache).

         cd ../apache_1.3*
         ./configure \
                --prefix=/usr/local/apache \
                --enable-module=most \
                --enable-shared=max \
                --activate-module=src/modules/perl/libperl.a \
                --with-perl=/usr/local/bin/perl \
                --enable-module=ssl
         make
         make certificate
         make install

    6. Install mod_perl
         cd ../mod_perl*
         make install

   7.4.  Apache Configuration Files

    Add the following lines in your "httpd.conf".

    Your "httpd.conf" will live in "/usr/local/apache/conf" if you installed
    using my method.

    1. In the Global Section
        Add this line once in the end of "httpd.conf" not in a VirtualHost
        section.

            Include /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco_apache.conf

    2. No virtualhosts
        If you do not have virtual hosts setup and/or you have a main
        server, add this line right after the first include :

            Include /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco_apache_dir.conf

    3. In each VirtualHost
        If you have Virtual Hosts or are setting up a secure server, put the
        following line in each of them that you want Netdisco turned on for:

        If you are not using Virtual Hosts, then add this line under the
        *netdisco_apache.conf* line.

            Include /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco_apache_dir.conf

        Make sure you have this include line for the secure server virtual
        host *:443 at the bottom of http.conf.

   7.5. Mason Data Directory

    Set the mason data directory writable to the apache user that does the
    requests.

    Assuming "nobody" is the user that apache requests run this as "root" :

        mkdir /usr/local/netdisco/mason
        chown nobody.netdisco /usr/local/netdisco/mason

    The name of the user is listed in "httpd.conf" under the "User"
    directive.

    Note: Some Linux distributions such as Redhat 6.x install mod_perl as a
    Dynamic Shared Object (DSO). This is known to be unstable, especially
    with Mason. Compile mod_perl statically using the method listed above.

  8. Perl Modules and Mason

    Below is a list of required modules for Netdisco, freely available from
    CPAN (http://www.cpan.org). Many of these modules have prerequisite
    modules.

   8.1. Install required Perl modules from CPAN

    Use the CPAN module that comes with Perl to install the modules and
    their prerequisites automatically:

        perl -MCPAN -e shell

            o conf prerequisites_policy ask
            install Digest::MD5
            install Bundle::DBI
            install Apache::DBI
            install DBD::Pg
            install DB_File      (for Apache::Session)
            install Apache::Session
            install Apache::Test (for Apache::Request, you may need to do a 'force install')
            install Apache::Request
            install HTML::Mason
            install MasonX::Request::WithApacheSession
            install Graph
            install GraphViz     (you may need to do a 'force install')

    Some of these you will probably already have installed. Others you may
    need to force with "force install ModuleName"

   8.2. Perl Location header in executables.

    If you have Perl installed in "/usr/bin", make sure that netdisco and
    bin/doc_munge have the correct location for Perl listed at the very top
    of the file.

  9. Netdisco Configuration

    1. netdisco.conf
        Modify netdisco.conf to match your site.

        See README for detailed configuration descriptions.

    2. netdisco_apache.conf
        Change settings on lines:

            session_user_name
            session_password
            session_cookie_domain

    3. netdisco.crontab
        Change "!!center_network_device_here!!" to a network device that is
        well connected to the main segment by CDP.

    4. Add a user in Netdisco
        This is a user inside the Netdisco database that will be your Web
        Admin User

            /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco -u username

        Add more users from the web "Admin Panel" once Netdisco is up and
        running.

    5. Make Documentation
        This step is only necessary if you have installed from CVS.

        i. Perl Location
            Make sure that the "POD2TEXT" lines in Makefile point to where
            your Perl binaries are installed.

        ii. Create Docs
             cd /usr/local/netdisco && gmake doc

    6. Change Permissions on Config files
        Since the config files contain SNMP community strings and database
        passwords, you must make them only available to the administrators
        for security.

         chgrp netdisco /usr/local/netdisco/*.conf
         chmod 660 /usr/local/netdisco/*.conf

  10. OUI Database

    The Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) database allows Netdisco to
    identify the manufacture of a network card using the first 24 bits of a
    MAC address.

    The database of OUIs is needed by Netdisco and is available from the
    IEEE.

    If you have "lynx" installed you can install the OUI database by:

        cd /usr/local/netdisco
        make oui

    ("gmake" for BSD/Solaris)

    Or do this by hand:

    1. Download oui.txt from http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/
    2. Run "netdisco -O"

    A note about Make versions. The Makefile is a GNU Make version file. In
    BSD you may have to type "gmake".

  11. Start Apache

    Now that you have everything setup, (re)start the web-server.

    Check Apache's error_log for possible errors.

    HomeGrown Copies of Apache
            /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start

    Used the Apache installed by Mandrake
            /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart

    Also, make sure that Apache starts on its own at reboot.

  12. Discover a Device in Netdisco

    Pick a device that you can access with the command "snmpwalk". Tell
    Netdisco to discover that device:

        cd /usr/local/netdisco
        ./netdisco -d devicename

    Make sure that this step actually works. This is a good metric that you
    have now installed Netdisco correctly. Add the *-D* flag to get copious
    debugging info.

  13. Create Network Topology

    See README for a description of *Topology Information*.

    If your network is CDP aware, pick a device that you consider close to
    the center of the network and start an auto-discovery from there:

        cd /usr/local/netdisco
        ./netdisco -r device_name_or_ip_number_here

    If your network is *not* CDP friendly, then see README for how to use
    the manual topology file netdisco-topology.txt.

  14. Test Web Side

    First restart Apache so that netdisco will see the changes that you have
    made in netdisco.conf. Note that a *graceful* restart will not re-read
    the configuration file. A full restart is required.

        /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl restart

    Point a browser to */netdisco* on the server you have Netdisco installed
    on. If everything is working you should be able to login with the user
    name and password you added in Step 10. You should also be able to
    access the Admin Panel.

    If you have problems, check the error_log of apache for messages.

        tail /usr/local/apache/logs/error_log

  15. Add Cron Jobs

    Once you're sure Netdisco is setup correctly, modify netdisco.crontab.
    Change the _center_device_ to one of your core routers or switches.

        vi netdisco.crontab

    Now set the crontab to the "netdisco" user.

        su - -c "crontab -u netdisco /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco.crontab"

    You may want to fine-tune these jobs to your network.

  16. Start Admin Daemon

    The admin deaemon performs administration jobs that are requested from
    the web front-end. See README for a description of the admin daemon.

        su - netdisco -c "/usr/local/netdisco/netdisco -p start"

    The daemon will be respawned daily in the Cron job listed above.

    If you would like the Daemon to be started upon bootup, then add the
    following line to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local file :

        su netdisco -c "/usr/local/netdisco/netdisco -p start"

SUCCESS

    Now that you have spent ten hours of your life installing this go drink
    a Beer, you deserve it.

    Once you have or have not succeeded, come join the Netdisco User's
    mailing list at <http://netdisco.org> and pass on any hints you may have
    in the INSTALL process.

    It's a good place to keep up on new features and releases, and it's the
    place to ask any questions.
