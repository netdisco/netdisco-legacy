Netdisco CVS Fedora Install Script

This script will install Netdisco CVS on a stock Fedora Core 4
installation using apache2 and mod_perl2.
 

UNSUPPORTED -  Please use at your own risk.   
This script was contributed by Kaven Rousseau and was modified for Fedora by Walter Gould.
 
 
 
 
Please read the below items that will help you to run this script and get netdisco installed:
 
 
 1)  This script uses CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) to install the needed perl modules.
     If you have not used CPAN before on the machine you are about to install netdisco on, CPAN will walk
     you through a few steps in order to configure itself. There is one option that will help you in
     installing the perl modules.  It is the 'prerequisites_policy'.  Set the 'prerequisites_policy'
     option to 'follow' during CPAN configuration.
 
 
 2)  Perl Module oddities:

    a)  During the installation of one of the perl modules, you are asked for the path of httpd and
        of apxs.  On Fedora Core 4 - both the httpd and apxs binaries are located in /usr/sbin.
 
 
    b)  During the installation of another of the perl modules, you will be asked if you want to
        'Skip the test suite?'  You should answer 'Yes' to this.  If not, the test will fail and
        the module will fail to install properly.
 
 
    c) If you are asked the location of the apache source during one of the perl modules installation,
       you can simply type 'q' as there is no apache source.  It is wanting to install mod_perl 1, and 
       we do not want mod_perl 1 installed as we are using mod_perl2 for this installation.  


    d) Quite often the Graph perl module does not install and has to be compiled manually. It will be
       download into the directory that the install script resides.  cd into the Graph dir and run 
       'perl Makefile.PL && make && make install'.   
       Note to Walter - find out why this happens and fix it. 


 3)  Make sure that 'selinux' is DISABLED or configured properly in order to allow netdisco
     to run properly.  This script assumes that selinux has been disabled.
 
 
 4)  Towards the end of the install script, netdisco attempts to discover devices on your
     network.  Please be patient and allow time for it to discover the devices on your network.
     It may take some time for the discovery process to complete.
 
 
 5)  Sometimes for whatever unkown reason - either httpd or postgresql fails to restart
     properly at the end of the install process.  If this appears to happen, you may need
     to manually restart these after the script has finished.  Do a 'ps -ef | grep httpd'
     or a 'ps -ef | grep postgresql' to see if they are running.  To start them you can
     run '/etc/init.d/httpd start' or '/etc/init.d/postgresql start'.
