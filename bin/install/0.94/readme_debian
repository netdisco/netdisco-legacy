     Netdisco Debian Install Script

     This script will install Netdisco on a stock Debian
     installation using apache2 and mod_perl2.


     UNSUPPORTED -  Please use at your own risk.   


     This script was originally contributed by Kaven Rousseau and
     has been modified by Walter Gould for a Debian installation.






Please read (and possibly print) the below items that will help you to run this script and get netdisco installed:


1)  This script uses CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) to install the needed perl modules.
    If you have not used CPAN before on the machine you are about to install netdisco on, CPAN will walk
    you through a few steps in order to configure itself. There is one option that will help you in
    installing the perl modules.  It is the 'prerequisites_policy'.  Set the 'prerequisites_policy'
    option to 'follow' during CPAN configuration.  If CPAN asks if you would like to configure it a
    second time during the installation of the perl modules, just reply 'no'.


2)  You need to ensure that iptables is not blocking udp port 161 and tcp ports 80 and/or 443.
    Otherwise, it will appear that netdisco is not working, when really it is your firewall that is the culprit.


3)  This script was tested on Debian 3.1R2 using a 2.6 kernel, Apache 2.xx and mod_perl 2.02.


4)  During the installation of the Apache::Test perl module, you are asked for the paths of the httpd
    and of apxs binaries.  The httpd (or apache2) binary, as it is called on Debian, is located in /usr/sbin.
    The apxs (or apxs2) binary is located in /usr/bin/.


5)  If you are asked for the location of the apache source, just type 'q' as apache was not compiled from source.


6)  Towards the end of the install script, netdisco attempts to discover devices on your
    network.  Please be patient and allow time for it to discover the devices on your network.
    It may take some time for the discovery process to complete.


7)  Sometimes - either apache or postgresql fails to restart properly at the end of the
    install process.  If this appears to happen, you may need to manually restart these
    after the script has finished.  Do a 'ps -ef | grep apache2' or a 'ps -ef | grep postgresql'
    to see if they are running.  To start them you can run '/etc/init.d/apache2 start'
    or '/etc/init.d/postgresql start'.


8)  Configuring apache to use mod_ssl on Debian is beyond the scope of this script.  However, the libapache-mod-ssl
    package will be installed below - you just need to configure apache and mod_ssl to jive together.
