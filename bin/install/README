Netdisco INSTALL Scripts

Hand-Crafted by Walter Gould

http://www.auburn.edu/~gouldwp/netdisco/

"The below scripts will automate a Netdisco apache2 and mod_perl2 installation.
There may some instances where the script(s) do not produce the desired results
and you may have to manually tweak things to get disco working properly.
Please use at your own risk - the below scripts are unsupported.   Hopefully,
they will help to speed up the installation and lessen your work and/or
frustration.   As time permits, I will add new scripts as new versions are
released.   If you have modified one of the below scripts to work with a
distribution that is not listed, and would like to make it available, please
contact me."
