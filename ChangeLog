1.3.1 (2013-07-08)
Bugfixes:
    * []        Include 'topology' table when DB is (re)created
    * []        Updates to 'node' and 'node_wireless' table definitions

1.3 (2013-05-20)
Bugfixes:
    * []        Undefined MAC would make is_mac() die (N. Giefing)
    * []        Apply quotemeta to avoid Inventory explosion (T. Gerlach)
    * [94]      Netdisco -O does not import oui.txt due to spaces in oui.txt

1.2 (2013-04-13)
Features:
    * [3598045] Collect VLAN in macsuck (Jiri Dvorak)
    * [3598089] Collect SSID in macsuck (Jiri Dvorak)
    * []        Capture BSSID, per AP MAC, associated with wireless SSID in
                device_port_ssid table if available.
    * []        Add config directive "reverse_lookup_ipv6" to control whether 
                reverse DNS lookups should be performed for IPv6 addresses.
    * []        Add option to node.html to search for entries only appearing on
                a given date.
    * []        Config directive "macsuck_no_vlan" now accepts both vlan names
                and numbers (VIDs). Patch from Peter Hicks.
    * []        Collect and display "vmVlanType", indicating whether a VLAN is
                static or dynamic on a switch port. Currently Cisco-specific.
                Patch from Wolfgang Friebel.
    * []        New database table "topology" to support adding topology links
                without a discovery protocol or an external topology text file.
    * []        New config option "snmpdiscover_timeout" to override SNMP
                timeout during discovery.  This speeds up finding the correct
                SNMP string when default timeout needs to be large.
    * []        Add report "Inventory by Name", patch from Laurens Vets.
    * []        Add config option for macsuck to ignore specific VLANs on

    + []	Change job log dir creation to use mkpath to resolve potential
                race condition.
    + []        Fix wireless client info collection to properly manage its
                transaction.
