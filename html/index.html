Netdisco is an Open Source web-based network management tool.  
<P>
Here are some of the favorite uses for this tool:
<UL>
    <LI><b>Locate</b> a machine on the network by MAC or IP and show the switch port it lives at.
    <LI><b>Turn Off</b> a switch port while leaving an audit trail.  Admins log why a port was shut down.
    <LI><b>Inventory</b> your network hardware by model, vendor, switch-card, firmware and operating system.
    <LI><b>Report</b> on IP address and switch port usage: historical and current.
    <LI><b>Pretty pictures</b> of your network.
</UL>
<P>
Things connected to the network are divided into two categories: 
<UL>
    <LI><b>Devices</b> - Network appliances such as routers, switches,
	and hubs that support SNMP.  Each device has multiple
	interfaces (ports) and can have IPs assigned to those
	interfaces.  
    <LI><b>Nodes</b> - Anything on the network that has a MAC address that is not a device:
	printers, computers, servers, IP phones, and any device that we do not have SNMP access to.
	<P>See <A HREF="doc/README.html#glossary">the Glossary</a> for more details.
</UL>

If you have problems with Netdisco you should :

<OL>
    <LI>Talk to your Network Administrator who installed Netdisco
    <LI><A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80033">Check for a Newer Release</A> of Netdisco
        and SNMP::Info.

<h1 class="pagehead">Development</h1>
<P>
The developers are now maintaining a registry of Netdisco installs.  This is
mainly for morale boosting purposes, but also helps us direct feature requests
to our target audience.  One drawback of the Source Forge system is that we
have no idea how many people are using the software compared to the number of
downloads.  
Please spend a minute to let us know you're using Netdisco at 
<A HREF="http://netdisco.org/register.html" onclick="window.open(this.href,'netdiscoregister'); return false">http://netdisco.org/register.html</A>.

<P>
<hr class="halfwidth">
<A HREF="http://netdisco.org">Netdisco</a> is an Open Source project 
headed up by developers Eric Miller, Bill Fenner, Oliver Gorwits and Max Baker,
originally created at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu">UCSC</a>

All bug reports, bug patches, feature enhancements and requests and issues are
served through <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/netdisco">Source Forge</A>
and our mailing lists.  New developers and maintainers are always welcome.
