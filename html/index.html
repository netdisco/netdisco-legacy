<h3>Intro</h3>
Netdisco is an Open Source web-based network management tool. 
<P>
Network devices are inventoried by both device model and operating system (IOS). 
Nodes connected to the network devices are located by switch port, IP address or MAC address.
For each node, a time stamped history of the ports it has visited and the IP addresses 
it has used is maintained.
Netdisco uses router ARP tables and L2 switch MAC forwarding tables to locate nodes on 
physical ports and track them by their IP addresses. 
<P>
Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) optionally provides automatic discovery of the network topology. 
Netdisco gets all its data including CDP information from SNMP.
It does not use CLI access and has no need for privilege passwords. 
Security features include a wire-side Wireless Access Point (AP) locator.
<P>
Things connected to the network are divided into two categories: 
<UL>
    <LI><u>Devices</u> - Network appliances such as routers,switches, and hubs that
        support SNMP.  Each device has multiple interfaces (ports) and 
        can have IPs assigned to those interfaces.  
    <LI><u>Nodes</u> - Anything on the network that has a MAC address that isn't a device :
        Printers, Computers, Servers... 
</UL>
