<h3>Intro</h3>
Netdisco is an network management application.  
<P>
Netdisco collects statistics about the device that create a network, and the nodes that
are attached to those devices.  

<P>Layer 2 Network topology is automatically generated using Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP),
and Bay's Topology Discovery.  Topology information is also enterable manually.
<P>
Things connected to the network are divided into two categories: 
<UL>
    <LI><u>Devices</u> - Network appliances such as routers,switches, and hubs that
        support SNMP.  Each device has multiple interfaces (ports) and 
        can have IPs assigned to those interfaces.  
    <LI><u>Nodes</u> - Anything on the network that has a MAC address that isn't a device :
        Printers, Computers, Servers... 
</UL>
