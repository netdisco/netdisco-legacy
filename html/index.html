<h3>Intro</h3>
Netdisco is an network management application.  
<P>
Netdisco collects statistics about the device that create a network, and the nodes that
are attached to those devices.  

<P>Layer 2 Network topology is automatically generated using Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP),
and Bay's Topology Discovery.  Topology information is also enterable manually.
<P>
Things connected to the network are divided into two categories: 
<UL>
    <LI><u>Devices</u> - Network appliances such as routers,switches, and hubs that
        support SNMP.  Each device has multiple interfaces (ports) and 
        can have IPs assigned to those interfaces.  
    <LI><u>Nodes</u> - Anything on the network that has a MAC address that isn't a device :
        Printers, Computers, Servers... 
</UL>

<h3>Known Issues and Current Work</h3>

<FORM>
<UL>
    <LI>Web based admin - Ability to do some admin tasks via a web interface.
    <LI>Release - Open Source release, prep, packaging...
    <LI>CATALYST 2926 - On daily refresh, some devices (pcat,kcat) dont have all their data for their interfaces. 
    Some SNMP wierdness with 2926's. 
    <LI>LOCALHOST - 127.0.0.x Showing up here and there -- SSRES is squawking
    it's IP as localhost via CDP
</UL>

<!-- back burner
    <LI>Limit connected device view by age in device
    <LI>Statistics on ports that are inactive by connected device age
    <LI>Refresh device/mac buttons?
    <LI>Current speed vs admin speed
    <LI>Link into billing/contact info?
    <LI>BAY - Need topology info for bay 405 devices.

<h3>Recently Finished Bugs and Features</H3>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
    <LI>DEVICE_SEARCH - Added search for ports that are blocking or broken (STP)
    <LI>DEVICE - Added new indicator for ports that are blocking via STP
    <LI>STP - Added suport in SNMP::Info::Bridge for STP values
    <LI>Port Admin  - Module to administratvely enable/disable ports <LI>C3550 - Added SubClass for Catalyst 3550 L2/L3 Switches.
    <LI>GRAPH - Fixed topology problems and switched to radial layout.
    <LI>SNMP::Info - Changed HPs to resolve Jxxxx part number to normal model number.
    <LI>NODE - Devices found in results will now point towards their device page
    <LI>NODE_SEARCH - Restructure of database and calls for speedups.
    <LI>BACKEND - Change in manual topology method so that manual topology information is added back in 
        every time a discover() happens.  This way the topology isn't broken for 2 hours every day while
        the refresh is happening. 
    <LI>Network Statistics.  Moved to separate page because they took too long to load.
    <LI>Layer 1.  Added subclass for Asante 1015 hubs. Fixed topology <LI>Layer 1 Devices.  New Feature.  Added support for Layer 1 managed devices, such as
    Asante Hubs.  Nodes attached will still be seen on the same port the Layer 1 device lives
    on.

Archive:
    <LI>Node Search - New Feature.  Search for nodes that have more than one IP address active on them.
    <LI>ARPNIP - Bug Fix.  Old IP Addresses were not being archived correctly.  Nodes on dynamic-IP
    were having IP's piling up.  Will correct itself as each IP is seen again, thereby archiving
    the older times it was seen. 
    <LI>Device Search - New Feature.  Search for device ports with more than one active node attached.
    <LI>Device Search - New Feature.  Search for device alias IP's without DNS entries.
    <LI>Graph - Devices w/out DNS but that are still good are now grey, not red.
    <LI>Discovery - Fixed bug that if you discovered on an alias name, the root IP would be found,
        but not the root dns entry.
    <LI>Discovery - Nasty bug that created loop in discovery process fixed.
    <LI>DEVICE - Failed quick searches now roll-over to a full text search on device_search
    <LI>Speedup node_search by OUI
    <LI>Set timeout for macwalk() for problem devices like that one bay 450
    <LI>Way to remove devices
    <LI>Way to expire Nodes/IPs
    <LI>Agestamp on MAC addresses in device
    <LI>Duplex MisMatch finder
    <LI>Pretty Print uptime
    <LI>Admin Duplex vs Current Duplex
    <LI>MACSUCK - Unique found vs total found - log?
    <LI>Multiple IP's (aliases) per device
    <LI>Logging / Time Stamps
    <LI>Node Search
    <LI>OID Database
    <LI>L2 Traceroute
    <LI>Database Speedups.  Added lots of indexing, speeding up things greatly.
    <LI>1900c - Got some more duplex and port info 
    <LI>RESNET - Some uplink ports on HP devices are still sucking mac addresses
        until we get the topology info in there (A or B port normally)
    <LI>Device_port - Remote CDP listed but not discovered - list as link to node. 
    <LI>SPEED - Slow response times on pages w/ lots of DNS lookups.  Removed to db call.
    <LI>NODE - Clean out MACs that match device port macs (see bothcat)
    <LI>CISCO 2900 - Mismatch in port names between 'neighbor' (CDP) and the real port for 2900's
    <LI>SIDEBAR - Node Search only accepts host/ip, not mac
    <LI>MAC - Ports that respond to CDP wont get their forwarding tables walked,
        even if we can't get access to them.  Solution : Walk the ports that have   
        a neighbor, but that doesnt exist in the device table (we dont have access to).
        See root.ucsc.edu should be on hub64/J7 but the IP phone is responding w/ CDP.
    <LI>2524 - Port name screwin up (ssres.resnet)
    <LI>FOUNDRY - Got some more info out of resnet-g
    <LI>Device Search - Search for IP only searches root devices, not aliases.
    <LI>ALIASES - Grouping devices w/ multiple ip/dns entries that are the same device.

If you get an ugly dump screen with lots of Perl debugging info, chances are i'm
in the process of breaking something, no need to mail me.

behavior on a seemingly working page, <a href="mailto:max@warped.org">mail me</a>.
