<h3>Intro</h3>
Netdisco is an Open Source web-based network management tool.  
<P>
Here are some of the favorite uses for this tool:
<UL>
    <LI>Find a Switch Port from a MAC or IP address and the reverse.
    <LI>Administratively disable a Switch Port while leaving an audit trail.
    <LI>Quickly provide configuration information for network devices.
    <LI>Inventory your network hardware by model, vendor and IOS.
    <LI>Control your IP address space; know who uses what IP and when.
    <LI>Historical data: know what IP and MAC addresses
        that are in use, <i>and were in use</i> on what ports.
    <LI>Pretty pictures of your network.
</UL>

<P>
Things connected to the network are divided into two categories: 
<UL>
    <LI><u>Devices</u> - Network appliances such as routers, switches, and hubs that
        support SNMP.  Each device has multiple interfaces (ports) and 
        can have IPs assigned to those interfaces.  
    <LI><u>Nodes</u> - Anything on the network that has a MAC address that isn't a device.
        Printers, Computers, Servers, Devices for which we don't have SNMP access.
</UL>
See <A HREF="doc/README.html#glossary">the glossary</a> for more details.
