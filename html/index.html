<h3>Intro</h3>
Netdisco is an Open Source web-based network management tool.

<TABLE>

    <TD>
        Here are some of the favorite uses for this tool:
        <UL>
            <LI>Find a Switch Port from a MAC or IP address and the reverse.
            <LI>Administratively disable a Switch Port while leaving an audit
                trail.<BR>
                <font size=-1>(Required ReadWrite SNMP passwords to be configured)</font>
            <LI>Quickly provide configuration information for network devices.
            <LI>Inventory your network hardware by model, vendor and IOS.
            <LI>Control your IP address space; know who uses what IP and when.
            <LI>Historical data: know what IP and MAC addresses
                that are in use, <i>and were in use</i> on what ports.
            <LI>Pretty pictures of your network.
        </UL>
        <P>
        Things connected to the network are divided into two categories: 
        <UL>
            <LI><u>Devices</u> - Network appliances such as routers, switches,
                and hubs that support SNMP.  Each device has multiple
                interfaces (ports) and can have IPs assigned to those
                interfaces.  
            <LI><u>Nodes</u> - Anything on the network that has a MAC address that isn't a device.
                Printers, Computers, Servers, Devices for which we don't have SNMP access.
                <P>See <A HREF="doc/README.html#glossary">the glossary</a> for more details.

        New Features:<BR>
        <TEXTAREA COLS=50 ROWS=4 WRAP=OFF>
[]        Apache-based HTTP authentication added.
[]        Apache2 + mod_perl2 support from Manuel Bouyer
[1107564] Disable BULKWALK on a per device or per device type basis:
          bulkwalk_no, arpnip_no, macsuck_no, discover_no use same syntax, see README
[1111654] Allow wrap in config file with \ char
[969117]  Automatically reloads config file in web front end when it changes.
[1392968] The map key is now automatically derived from configuration (i.e., entries in node_map)
[1107578] Port Control via VLANs
[744598]  Inventory by subnet - IP Inventory feature improved to dump whole subnets
[1107579] The map can be clustered by device Location fields.  Thanks to Bjorn Isaksson for the patch.
[1393653] Modules for optional features (e.g., NBT) are now loaded when needed, not at startup.
[1116552] The devices in the "Choose Device" box on the Admin Panel
          are now listed in numerical order by IP address, to make
          it easier to find the one you're looking for.
[1116547] Contact field is now searched in the device search.  New backend
          database field time_recent in node database, for nodes that move around a lot,
          it's the last time this node moved *back* to this device (time_first is the
          first time ever).  Add macsuck_only, arpnip_only, discover_only limits Get
          SSIDs and channel from wireless base station ports, and display SSID in device
          port, add SSID inventory and SSID search
[1462199] Add SNMP timeout parameter to create_device()
[1492791] Added options snmp_force_v*
[]        pg_all, pg_run, pg_init, pg_back unified into single sql/pg script
          This script parses netdisco.conf for database settings.

[1094208] "problemnode" attribute on network map was being overriden by default color settings.

<h3>Register</h3>
The developers are now maintaining a registry of Netdisco installs.  This is
mainly for morale boosting purposes, but also helps us direct feature requests
to our target audience.  One drawback of the Source Forge system is that we
have no idea how many people are using the software compared to the number of
downloads.  
<P>
Please spend a minute to let us know you're using Netdisco at 
<A HREF="http://netdisco.org/register.html" TARGET="_new">http://netdisco.org/register.html</A>.
