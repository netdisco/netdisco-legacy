Here are some of the favorite uses for this tool:
<UL>
    <LI>Find a Switch Port from a MAC or IP address and the reverse.
    <LI>Administratively disable a Switch Port while leaving an audit
	trail.<BR>
	<span class="small">(Required ReadWrite SNMP passwords to be configured)</span>
    <LI>Quickly provide configuration information for network devices.
    <LI>Inventory your network hardware by model, vendor and IOS.
    <LI>Control your IP address space; know who uses what IP and when.
    <LI>Historical data: know what IP and MAC addresses
	that are in use, <i>and were in use</i> on what ports.
    <LI>Pretty pictures of your network.
</UL>
<P>
Things connected to the network are divided into two categories: 
<UL>
    <LI><span class="u">Devices</span> - Network appliances such as routers, switches,
	and hubs that support SNMP.  Each device has multiple
	interfaces (ports) and can have IPs assigned to those
	interfaces.  
    <LI><span class="u">Nodes</span> - Anything on the network that has a MAC address that isn't a device.
	Printers, Computers, Servers, Devices for which we don't have SNMP access.
	<P>See <A HREF="doc/README.html#glossary">the glossary</a> for more details.
</UL>

<h1 class="pagehead">Support</h1>
If you have problems with Netdisco you should :

<OL>
    <LI>Talk to your Network Administrator who installed Netdisco
    <LI><A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80033">Check for a Newer Release</A>
    <LI><A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=80033&amp;atid=558508">Check for Bugs</A>

</OL>
<h1 class="pagehead">Register</h1>
<P>
The developers are now maintaining a registry of Netdisco installs.  This is
mainly for morale boosting purposes, but also helps us direct feature requests
to our target audience.  One drawback of the Source Forge system is that we
have no idea how many people are using the software compared to the number of
downloads.  
<P>
Please spend a minute to let us know you're using Netdisco at 
<A HREF="http://netdisco.org/register.html" onclick="window.open(this.href,'netdiscoregister'); return false">http://netdisco.org/register.html</A>.
