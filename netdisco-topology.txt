# netdisco-topology.txt
# Manual Topology information used in netdisco
#
# Add a line for each device you want to add manually
# Add link lines for topology information in the format
#
# device
#   link:outport,destination router,destination port
#
# Basic Example:
# 
#   Let's connect these two routers manually:
#
# [router1]  --> [router2]
#  Port 14         Port 5
#
#   The following two lines would be added to this file:
#
#    router1
#      link:14,router2,5
#
#
# LoopBacks:
#   If you know a port is an uplink port but you don't
#   know where it goes, set it to iteself.
#
#   router1
#       link:1.2,router1,1.2
#
# Notes:
#   1. Only one side is needed, both sides are forced to this info
#   2. You can use DNS host names or IP addresses
#   3. See "Manual Topology Information" in README
