# Manual Topology information used in netdisco
#
# Add a line for each device you want to add manually
# Add link lines for topology information in the format
#
# device
#   link:outport,destination router,destination port
#
# An Example:
# 
# Let's connect these two routers manually:
#
# [router1]  --> [router2]
#  Port 14         Port 5
#
# The following two lines would be added to this file:
#
#    router1
#      link:14,router2,5
#
# Notes:
#   1. Only one side is needed, both sides are forced to this info
#   2. You can use DNS host names or IP addresses
#   3. See "Manual Topology Information" in README
