=head1 SUPPORT

Netdisco is hosted by Source Forge.

Please use the C<netdisco-users> mailing list for all problems and comments.

L<http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/netdisco-users>

Please use the Bug interface from Source Forge page at :

L<http://sourceforge.net/projects/netdisco>

Thanks to Mike Hunter at UCB for proofing this document.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

Netdisco is built using lots of fine Open-Source tools: 

=over

=item * Perl

5.6.1 and newer advised

=item * Perl Modules

Listed below

=item * Net-SNMP

5.0.2 and newer advised

=item * PostgreSQL

Developed under version 7.3

=item * Mason

1.16 or newer required

=item * Apache

1.3.x advised, Version 2.x not supported by mod_perl.

=item * mod_perl   

Version to match Apache

=item * GraphViz

=back

See I<INSTALL> below for details on how to retrieve and install each one.

=head2 OS

Netdisco was developed on a BSD system but should work on any
system that Postgres, Perl, Apache, and Net-SNMP run on. 

Linux is a sure bet.  Netdisco has been tested with Mandake 9.1 
and includes specific notes to install with it.  Successful installs
have been reported under Redhat, Mandrake and Debian.

Windows will take a lot of massaging but should be possible under
Cygwin.

For Debian Linux, read this whole document then see the install script
in F<bin/debian_install.sh>.

=head1 INSTALL

This is not a terribly easy install.  If you aren't comfortable 
installing programs from source and using a text editor, get some help.  Hopefully
this will all be rolled up into an install script by the time Netdisco comes out of Beta.

=head2 1. Download and Un-archive Netdisco

Get the newest version from L<http://www.netdisco.org>.

    tar xvfz netdisco-x.xx.tar.gz    

Create a directory for Netdisco 

    mkdir /usr/local/netdisco

Move files to that dir

    mv netdisco-x.xx/* /usr/local/netdisco

=head2 2. Create a Unix User/Group for Netdisco  

Create a user and group named C<netdisco>

=over

=item Linux

    useradd -d /usr/local/netdisco netdisco

=item BSD

    useradd netdisco

=back

Give this user permission to the files:

    chown -R netdisco.netdisco /usr/local/netdisco

=head2 3. Add Unix Administrators to Netdisco Group

Once Netdisco is up and running most administration
can be done from the Web interface.  Whoever will be doing
the back-end administration will need to have write access and will need
write access on Netdisco's files.

Add the unix account names of administrators that will modify the 
source code or use the command line interface interface to the C<netdisco>
group in F</etc/groups>.

Don't forget to logout and login after adding yourself to a group.

=head2 4. PostgreSQL

Netdisco runs Postgres as its database back-end.  A mySQL port 
is reported to be in development.

=head3 Install Postgres

=over

=item i. BSD 

    cd /usr/ports/database/postgres
    make install

=item ii. Mandrake Linux

Installing PostgreSQL the easy way:

    urpmi postgresql postgresql-devel postgresql-server postgresql-docs

The files you will need to edit below are in F</var/lib/pgsql/data>.

If you lost / don't have install CDs :

The following line uses an FTP site that has the 9.0 RPMs because I lost
the CDs.  Check the current mirror list at L<http://www.mandrakelinux.com/en/ftp.php3>
and choose a mirror close to you.

    urpmi.addmedia ftpsite ftp://mirror.mcs.anl.gov/pub/Mandrake-old/9.0/i586/Mandrake/RPMS \
        with ../base/hdlist.cz

Now you have to add C<--media ftpsite>  in each C<urpmi> command like so :

    urpmi --media ftpsite postgresql postgresql-devel

Remember this for the Apache setup too.

=item iv.  All Others

There is probably a binary package all ready for you.  See your distribution's instructions
for more help.  Otherwise download and compile the source code from L<http://www.postgresql.org>.

=back

=head3 Configure Postgres

Netdisco's settings in PostgreSQL are

 Database User     : netdisco
 Database Name     : netdisco
 Database Password : you choose it

Follow these steps to setup Netdisco in PostgreSQL.

=over 

=item i. Permissions

If you have just setup Postgres for the first time you may have to change the
default permissions in F<$PG_DATA/pg_hba.conf>.  

For installation you must give the database user access to the C<template1> database.
The following line will give all users who have logon permissions in Unix access
to the C<template1> database.

    local template1 all ident

Next you must give the C<netdisco> database user access to the C<netdisco> database.
The following line will give all database users access to a database that is the same
name as them.  This line must be put above all the rest of the uncommented lines in the
F<pg_hba.conf> file to take precedence.  

=over

=item Postgres 7.2


    local sameuser md5

You may have to change C<md5> to C<crypt>, Actual mileage may vary.

=item Postgres 7.3


    local sameuser all md5

=back

B<Restart Postgres>

Linux :

    /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql restart

FreeBSD :
    
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/*postgres* restart

If there are problems with this step you will receieve an error that mentions something
about F<pg_hba.conf>.

=item ii. Create Database.

First find out the name of your database user.  The default name for
some Linux RPM versions is C<postgres> and for some BSD installations C<pgsql>.

Edit the file C<pg_init> to match your database user name in F</usr/local/netdisco/sql/pg_init>

    vi /usr/local/netdisco/sql/pg_init

As root run C<sql/pg_init> to create the database and user for Netdisco.

The password you will be asked for twice is the new password for the database user you are creating. 
This is the same password you will be putting in F<netdisco_apache.conf>
and in F<netdisco.conf>.

    cd /usr/local/netdisco/sql
    ./pg_init

=item iii. Check Settings

Now as a non-privileged user make sure you can get into the database by running 
C<sql/pg_run>.  Enter the database user password given above. 

    cd /usr/local/netdiscosql
    ./pg_run

=item iv. Create Tables

Once you are sure the database is setup correctly, create the database 
tables with C<sql/pg_all>.  Type in the database user password once 
when prompted.

    cd /usr/local/netdiscosql
    ./pg_all

=item v. Optimizations

If you have freshly installed Postgresql then the default memory usage needs to
be increased for efficiency.  See the PostgreSQL documentation for 
F<postgresql.conf>.  Specifically you really need to up the maximum connections
and shared memory settings.  After you have Netdisco running on a large installation
it would be of great benefit to get a Postgres guru in there to tune things for you.
See F<README> for more info about how to speed things up now and again.

=item vi. Postgres Startup

Make sure that Postgres is set to start automatically.

=over

=item Linux


    chkconfig postgresql on

=item BSD

Make sure that the file in C</usr/local/etc/rc.d> is alright.

=back

=back

=head2 5. SNMP

There are three components to setup for SNMP

=head3 A) Net-SNMP

Net-SNMP 5 lives at L<http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net>.

=over

=item BSD

For BSD install Net SNMP with ports :

    cd /usr/ports/net/net-snmp && make install

TODO : How do I give it the switch to add C<--with-perl-modules> again?

=item Linux

If you have installed the Net-SNMP RPM from Redhat or Mandrake it B<does not> include 
the Perl modules.  Uninstall it and install a newer version by hand as below.

Same goes for Debian.  DO NOT use the apt-get version of Net-SNMP install
by hand (it's easy!).

=back

=over

=item i. Download Net-SNMP from http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net

This used to be called ucd-snmp.

=item ii. Install Net-SNMP to include Perl module that comes inside the distribution.

When you run C<./configure>, make sure you add the switch C<--with-perl-modules>

    ./configure --with-perl-modules
    make 
    make install

If you already have net-snmp installed, then go to the source directory and 
in the C<perl> subdirectory and run C<perl Makefile.PL>

    cd /path/to/net-snmp-5.0.x/perl
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install


 ********************************************************************

B<DO NOT> INSTALL the SNMP:: modules off of CPAN or the NET::SNMP module off of CPAN.

 ********************************************************************

Reread the above line.


=item iii. Run C<snmpconf> and set up your MIB directory. 

(Default F</usr/local/share/snmp/mibs>)

Make sure this new F<snmp.conf> lives in F</usr/local/share/snmp>

=back

=head3 B) SNMP::Info

This Perl module is an integral part of Netdisco.  It is available
from L<http://snmp-info.sourceforge.net>.   It requires that you have net-snmp installed
first.

SNMP::Info holds all the device-specific code to retrieve data from network devices via SNMP.
A wide variety of Cisco,HP,Bay, and Aironet devices are supported.  You may need to add support
for other devices if they do not follow a standard interface.  This is not too complex.  See 
SNMP::Info for more details.

You have three different options in installing SNMP::Info

=over

=item a. CPAN

    perl -MCPAN -e shell
    install SNMP::Info

=item b. From Source

Download newest version from L<http://snmp-info.sourceforge.net>

    tar xvfz SNMP-Info-0.x.tar.gz 
    cd SNMP-Info-0.x
    perl Makefile.PL
    make install

=item c. From CVS

If you plan to add or change device support in SNMP::Info to customize Netdisco to your devices,
you should install SNMP::Info this way. 

    make snmp

This will create the SNMP/ directory where SNMP::Info will live.   Periodically you should re-run

    make snmp

To update to the most current CVS version.

=back

=head3 C) MIBs

MIBs are required for F<SNMP::Info>. 


=over

=item Download MIBs

Download the Version 1 and Version 2 MIBs from 

    ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/v1/v1.tar.gz
    ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/v2/v2.tar.gz

=item Install MIBs

Install all of the V2 and some of the V1 MIBs into F</usr/local/share/snmp/mibs>.

    cd /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs
    tar xvfz /path/to/v2.tar.gz
    tar xvfz /path/to/v1.tar.gz BRIDGE-MIB.my SNMP-REPEATER-MIB.my ESSWITCH-MIB.my

=item Fix CISCO-TC-MIB

There is a problem with the Cisco file F<CISCO-TC.my> which 
is included from lots of other MIBs.   Make the following changes
if you run into errors about C<Unsigned32> in this file.

Edit F</usr/local/share/snmp/mibs/CISCO-TC.my>

Comment out line 192 that says C<SMI Unsigned32> with two dashes.

    -- SMI Unsigned32

Add C<Unsigned32> to the imports after line 19:

    IMPORTS
        MODULE-IDENTITY,
        Gauge32,
        Integer32,
        Counter64,
        Unsigned32,
            FROM SNMPv2-SMI

=back

Follow the instructions in C<SNMP::Info>
what MIBs to install for non Cisco devices or in case of trouble.

    perldoc SNMP::Info

=head2 6. OUI Database

The Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) database allows Netdisco to 
identify the manufacture of a network card using the first 24 bits of a
MAC address.  

The database of OUIs is needed by Netdisco and is available from the IEEE.

If you have C<lynx> installed you can install the OUI database by:

    cd /usr/local/netdisco
    make oui

Or do this by hand:

=over

=item i. Download F<oui.txt> from http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/

=item ii. Run C<netdisco -O>

=back

A note about Make versions.  The Makefile is a GNU Make version file.  In BSD you may
have to type C<gmake>.

=head2 7. GraphViz 

GraphViz is used in the creation of the Network Map.

To Download:

=over

=item i. Download 

=over

=item BSD

For BSD use ports: 

    cd /usr/ports/graphics/graphviz && make install

=item Linux

For Redhat and Mandrake systems you will make sure that a lol of
C<-devel> packages are installed.   If you see errors about not having a PNG
or JPEG library then install the C<-devel> packages as needed. 

    urpmi libjpeg62-devel libpng3-devel

If you get some weird error in build about not having C<intl.la> then
make sure you have the F<gettext> packages installed :

    urpmi gettext-devel

=item Unix

Get the newest version from L<http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz>.
Unarchive and install.

=back

=item ii. True Type Font

Copy a True Type Font file (F<.ttf>) into the Netdisco directory and 
change C<node_font> in F<netdisco.conf> to match.

    cp /path/to/windows/fonts/lucon.ttf /usr/local/netdisco

=item iii. Graph Settings

Review other graph settings in F<netdisco.conf>

=item iv. Check Path

Make sure that neato/twopi is in your path, and/or in the crontab path
that creates the graphs.

    which twopi
    which neato

=back

After the Perl Modules step below, 
make sure the Graphviz Perl module got installed

    perldoc GraphViz

=head2 8. Setup Apache

I<Apache2> -- 

Until mod_perl 2.0 is released as stable, Mason will not run under Apache2.  
Netdisco will not run under Apache2 until that point.

=head3 Mandrake 9.1

Mandrake 9.1 comes with Apache2.  It also has the option
of installing a version of Apache1/mod_perl on a different port
and then reverse proxying it.   

mod_ssl with Mandrake to come...

=over

=item Install Apache1

Install Apache1 and Mod_Perl 1 and their development packages :

    urpmi apache-devel-1 mod_perl-devel-1 apache-mod_perl-1 mod_perl-common-1

Mandrake 9.1 - Do this for the DB_File Perl module

    ln -s /usr/include/db1/* /usr/include
    ln -s /usr/lib/libdb1.so.2 /usr/lib/libdb.so

=item Configure Both Apaches

Mandrake and some Redhats come with two copies of Apache installed.
The mod_perl server sits on a weird port and is reversed proxied by
a normal Apache server.  

Mandrake 9.0 uses two Apache1 servers, while Mandrake 9.1 uses an
Apache2 server that sits in front of the apache1/mod_perl server.

Configuration files for Mandrake live in F</etc/httpd/conf>

In the file F<httpd-perl.conf> add the two C<Include> lines:

    Include /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco_apache.conf
    Include /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco_apache_dir.conf

In the file F<httpd.conf> (F<httpd2.conf> for 9.1) add the final C<RewriteRule> line:

    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule ^proxy:.*  -  [F]
    RewriteRule ^(.*\/perl\/.*)$  http://%{HTTP_HOST}:8200$1 [P]
    RewriteRule ^(.*\/cgi-perl\/.*)$  http://%{HTTP_HOST}:8200$1 [P]
    RewriteRule ^(.*\/netdisco\/.*)$  http://%{HTTP_HOST}:8200$1 [P]
    </IfModule>

In the file F<commonhttpd.conf> add the Alias line :

    Alias /netdisco /netdisco/
                    
=item Restart Apache

    /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart

=back

=head3 Apache From Scratch

=over

=item Install Apache 1.3.x and mod_perl 1.x and mod_ssl

Netdisco is designed to work in a secure (https) or non-secure
environment.  Due to the security and privacy concerned associated with
this data, using a secure server is recommended.

Below is my method if you haven't installed apache and mod_perl before.
I statically compile mod_perl, and mod_ssl then leave the rest of the 
modules as dynamically loadable objects (DSO).

=over

=item i. Download and Unarchive

Get Apache from L<http://httpd.apache.org>

Get mod_perl from L<http://perl.apache.org>

Get mod_ssl from L<http://www.modssl.org>

Unarchive all three to the same directory, maybe F</usr/local/src>

=item ii. In apache_1.3.x/  

 ./configure 

Sets up the directory scheme.

=item iii. In mod_ssl

=over 

=item BSD


Installing OpenSSL :

    cd /usr/ports/devel/mm && make install
    cd /usr/ports/security/openssl && make install

Setup mod_ssl :

    cd /path/to/mod_ssl_1.x.x
    SSL_BASE=SYSTEM \
        ./configure \
            --with-apache=../apache_1.3.x \
            --disable_rule=SSL_COMPAT

=item RedHat / Mandrake

OpenSSL is installed by default.

You will have to tell the OS to look for the Kerberos libraries
used in this version of OpenSSL:

    ./configure \
        --with-apache=../apache_1.3.x \        
        --disable_rule=SSL_COMPAT
    make C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/kerberos/include

Thanks to David Martin for this info.

=item By Hand (other OSs)

Follow the instructions in the F<INSTALL> that comes with C<mod_ssl>

 SSL_BASE=/path/to/openssl-0.9.x \
 ./configure \
    --with-apache=../apache_1.3.x \        
    --disable_rule=SSL_COMPAT

=back

=item iv. In mod_perl-1.2x/

 /usr/local/bin/perl Makefile.pl \
        APACHE_SRC=../apache_1.3.x/src \
        EVERYTHING=1 \
        DO_HTTPD=1 \
        USE_APACI=1 \
        PREP_HTTPD=1

 make

=item v. Back in apache_1.3.x/

 ./configure \
        --prefix=/usr/local/apache \
        --enable-module=most \
        --enable-shared=max \
        --activate-module=src/modules/perl/libperl.a \
        --with-perl=/usr/local/bin/perl \
        --enable-module=ssl
 make
 make certificate
 make install

=item vi. Back in mod_perl-1.2x/

 make install

=back

=item httpd.conf

Add the following lines in your C<httpd.conf>. 

Your C<httpd.conf> will live in C</usr/local/apache/conf> if you installed using my method.

=over

=item a. In the Global Section

Add this line B<once> in the end of C<httpd.conf> not in a VirtualHost section.

    Include /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco_apache.conf

=item b. No virtualhosts

If you do not have virtual hosts setup and/or you have a main server, add this line right after the 
first include :

    Include /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco_apache_dir.conf

=item c. In each VirtualHost

If you have Virtual Hosts or are setting up a secure server, put the following
line in each of them that you want Netdisco turned on for:

If you are not using Virtual Hosts, then add this line under the I<netdisco_apache.conf> line.

    Include /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco_apache_dir.conf

=back

=item Mason Data Directory

Set the mason data directory writable to the apache user that does the 
requests.

Assuming C<nobody> is the user that apache requests run this as C<root> :

    mkdir /usr/local/netdisco/mason
    chown nobody.netdisco /usr/local/netdisco/mason

The name of the user is listed in C<httpd.conf> under the C<User> directive. 


=back

Note: Some Linux distributions such as Redhat 6.x install mod_perl as 
a Dynamic Shared Object (DSO).  This is known to be unstable, especially
with Mason.   Compile mod_perl statically using the method listed
above.

=head2 9. Perl Modules and Mason

Below is a list of required modules for Netdisco, freely available from
CPAN (http://www.cpan.org).   Many of these modules have prerequisite 
modules.   

Use the CPAN module that comes with Perl to install the modules
and their prerequisites automatically:

    perl -MCPAN -e shell

        install Digest::MD5
        install Bundle::DBI
        install Apache::DBI
        install DBD::Pg
        install DB_File      (for Apache::Session)
        install Apache::Session
        install Apache::Test (for Apache::Request, you may need to do a 'force install')
        install Apache::Request
        install HTML::Mason
        install MasonX::Request::WithApacheSession
        install Graph
        install GraphViz     (you may need to do a 'force install')

Some of these you will probably already have installed.

=head3 Perl Location

If you have Perl installed in C</usr/bin>, make sure that F<netdisco> and F<bin/doc_munge>
have the correct location for Perl listed at the very top of the file.

=head2 10. Netdisco Configuration

=over

=item netdisco.conf

Modify F<netdisco.conf> to match your site.  

See F<README> for detailed configuration descriptions.

=item netdisco_apache.conf

Change settings on lines:

    session_user_name
    session_password
    session_cookie_domain

=item netdisco.crontab

Change C<!!center_network_device_here!!> to a network device that is well connected to the main
segment by CDP.


=item Add a user in Netdisco

This is a user inside the Netdisco database that will be your Web Admin User

    /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco -u username

Add more users from the web C<Admin Panel> once Netdisco is up and running.

=item Make Documentation

This step is only necessary if you have installed from CVS.

=over 

=item i. Perl Location

Make sure that the C<POD2TEXT>  lines in F<Makefile> point to where your Perl binaries
are installed.

=item ii. Create Docs

 cd /usr/local/netdisco && make doc

=back

=back

=head2 11. Start Apache

Now that you have everything setup, (re)start the 
web-server.

Check Apache's F<error_log> for possible errors.

=over

=item Linux


    /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart

=item HomeGrown Copies of Apache


    /usr/local/apache/apachebin start

=back

Also, make sure that Apache starts on its own
at reboot.

=head2 12. Discover a Device in Netdisco

Pick a device that you can access with the command C<snmpwalk>.  
Tell Netdisco to discover that device:

    cd /usr/local/netdisco
    ./netdisco -d devicename

Make sure that this step actually works.  This is a good metric that you have 
now installed Netdisco correctly.  Add the I<-D> flag to get copious debugging info.

=head2 13. Create Network Topology

See F<README> for a description of I<Topology Information>.  

If your network is CDP aware, pick a device that you consider close to the center of the 
network and start an autodiscovery from there:

    cd /usr/local/netdisco
    ./netdisco -r device_name_or_ip_number_here

If your network is I<not> CDP friendly, then see F<README> for how to
use the manual topology file F<netdisco-topology.txt>.

=head2 14. Test Web Side

First restart Apache so that netdisco will see the changes that you have made
in F<netdisco.conf>.  Note that a I<graceful> restart will not re-read the configuration
file.  A full restart is required.

    /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl restart

Point a browser to I</netdisco>  on the server you have Netdisco installed on. 
If everything is working you should be able to login with the username and password
you added in Step 10.  You should also be able to access the Admin Panel.

If you have problems, check the F<error_log> of apache for messages.

    tail /usr/local/apache/logs/error_log

=head2 15. Add Cron Jobs

Once you're sure Netdisco is setup correctly add the Cron jobs listed in
F<netdisco.crontab>.

    su - -c "cron -u netdisco /usr/local/netdisco/netdisco.crontab"

You may want to fine-tune these jobs to your network.

=head2 16. Start Admin Daemon

The admin deaemon performs administration jobs that are requested from the
web front-end.  See F<README> for a description of the admin daemon.  

    su - netdisco -c "/usr/local/netdisco/netdisco -p start"

The daemon will be respawned daily in the Cron job listed above. 

If you would like the Daemon to be started upon bootup, then add
the following line to your F</etc/rc.d/rc.local> file :

    su netdisco -c "/usr/local/netdisco/netdisco -p start"

=head1 SUCCESS

Once you have succeded come join the Netdisco User's mailing list at 
L<http://netdisco.org> and pass on any hints you may have in the INSTALL process.
It's a good place to keep up on new features and releases, and it's B<the>
place to ask any questions.
