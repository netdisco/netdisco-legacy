UPGRADING

    Here are some hints for upgrading between versions of Netdisco.

    The best way is to back everything up, move the configuration files out
    of the way, and then follow INSTALL for all but the database steps.

    Then change the configuration files back to match.

    You shouldn't have to upgrade apache, but now would be a good time to
    see if there are any security upgrades to apache or mod_perl.

  SNMP::Info

    When upgrading to any version, please make sure you have the newest
    version of SNMP::Info installed (at least 0.7) :

    CVS Version
        To update a CVS version of SNMP::Info :

            cd /usr/local/netdisco/SNMP
            cvs update

    CPAN Version
        To update a version installed by CPAN :

            perl -MCPAN -e shell
            install SNMP::Info

    Manual Install Version
        Download the newest version from CPAN or
        http://snmp-info.sourceforge.net and install.

  General Upgrade

    Read INSTALL
        Read the INSTALL file that comes with the new version to see what
        has changed. Make sure you have all the Requirements listed.

    Backup Database
        For any version you will want to make backup copies of all your data
        first.

            cd /usr/local/netdisco/sql
            ./pg_dump

    Backup Configuration Files
        Make backups of all your configuration files.

            cp /usr/local/netdisco/*.conf /path/to/some_where_safe
            cp /usr/local/netdisco/*.txt  /path/to/some_where_safe

    Install on top of existing Netdisco
        Put the new files in your netdisco/ directory

            cp -R /path/to/netdisco-new-0.999 /usr/local/netdisco

    Upgrade Perl Modules
        Following the procedures in INSTALL, upgrade all the required Perl
        modules.

    Check Permissions
        Make sure the permissions are set to let the web user read the html/
        directory and write to the mason/ directory.

    Modify the Configuration Files
        New options are always being added to the config files and Netdisco.
        It's usually a lot cleaner to modify the new config file that comes
        with Netdisco than try to add the new features to the old one. This
        helps get rid of old bugs too.

  Version Notes

    v0.91 -> 0.92
        Make sure you run "Database Cleanup" or "-K" when you are done
        upgrading. The bug where the MAC address of switch ports showing up
        on their own port has been fixed. SNMP::Info Version 0.7 required.

    v0.90 -> 0.91
        netdisco_apache.conf
            Double check that your copy of netdisco_apache.conf has the
            settings right for all the "session_*" directives.

        GraphViz
            Make sure you have GraphViz 0.9 installed.
